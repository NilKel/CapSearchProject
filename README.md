# CapSearchProject

This project works to answer the question:  Is there a best U-Net architecture? 

It does this through the use of the keras-tuner. It is important to run the keras-tuner with the correct form of tensorflow and keras that you will need. This code is optimized through the use of GPUs, so it will need to be run with tensorflow-gpu. To run these packages, you must install the keras-tuner and then uninstall tensorflow and reinstall the tensorflow-GPU making sure that the keras-tuner doesn't get deleted in the process. 

To run the tuner, it is set up to run similar to the in keras models.
